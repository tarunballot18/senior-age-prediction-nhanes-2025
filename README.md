# NHANES Age Classification - AI Planet x CAC IITG | Summer Analytics 2025

This repository includes the solution developed for the hackathon conducted jointly by **AI Planet** and the **Consulting and Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati** as part of **Summer Analytics 2025**.

## 🧠 Problem Overview
Participants were given a processed version of the NHANES dataset from the CDC, which integrates both survey responses and clinical assessments to evaluate public health in the U.S.

The challenge was to build a model that can classify whether a person is **65 years or older** using:
- Physical measurements
- Lab data
- Lifestyle variables

The dataset contains:
- ~6.3k rows
- 7 primary features

## ⚙️ Workflow Summary
- Preprocessing and handling of missing data
- Insight generation through visual and statistical EDA
- Model training using classification techniques like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost
- Performance measurement with metrics such as AUC, Accuracy, and F1-score

## 💡 Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, xgboost

## ✅ Submission Protocol
The final notebook included here is identical to the one submitted on the **AI Planet Hackathon Portal** using the official registered email for **Summer Analytics 2025**.

## 🕒 Final Date
Submission deadline was **30th June 2025 (Monday), End of Day**
